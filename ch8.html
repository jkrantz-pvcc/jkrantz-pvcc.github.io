    <h1>Chapter 8: information Security</h1>

    <h2>Student: Joseph Krantz</h2>

    <h3>Briefly describe or define</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>information Security- protecting data from those who do not have permission to access it</li>
        <li>authentication- the process of verifying who has the right to gain access to the computer</li>
        <li>authorization- governs what an authenticated user of a computer is allowed to do</li>
        <li>dual authentication- a second authentication measure after the user enters the user ID and password</li>
        <li>social engineering- the process of using people to get the information you want</li>
        <li>virus- a computer program that embeds itself within another program or file in order to infect a host computer and then spread</li>
        <li>worm- can send copies of itself to other nodes on a computer network without having to be carried by an infected host file</li>
        <li>trojan horse- a computer program that does some legitimate computational task but, unbeknownst to the user, also contains code to perform malicious attacks</li>
        <li>ransomware- malware that invades a user's computer, encrypts all the files, then demands a ransom payment for the files to be released</li>
        <li>phising- sending emails purporting to be legitimate to a large number of potential victims in the hopes of luring users to visit a fake website, where personal information can be collected</li>
        <li>white hat- Security experts who try to keep us safe in cyberspace</li>
        <li>black hat- try to ferret out computer system weaknesses for financial gain, control, or outright destruction</li>
        <li>encryption/decryption- the process of using an algorithm to convert information into a representaion that cannot be understood or utilized by anyone without the appropiate decryption algorithm</li>
        <li>cryptography- the science of secret writing</li>
        <li>symmetric encryption algorithm- requires a secret key shared by sender and receiver</li>
        <li>caesar cipher- an encryption algorithm that shifts each character in the message to another character some fixed distance farther along in the alphabet </li>
        <li>block cipher- any encryption algorithm that encodes a block of characters together, so that each coded character is the result of several plaintext characters</li>
        <li>data encryption standard (DES)- a symmetric encryption algorithm developed in the 1970s but still widely used</li>
        <li>public key system- the encryption key for messages to go to a particular receiver is broadcast to everyone, but the decryption key cannot be derived from it and is known only by the receiver</li>
        <li>embedded computers- computational devices such as chips, processors, or computers that are embedded within another system</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Briefly describe how a text file can be hidden in a stenographic image:</h3>

    <ul>by changing the least significant bit of each byte of the image file to match the binary form of the characters in the text </ul>
       
    <h3>List six ways to protect yourself from most cyber attacks:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>up to date anitvirus software</li>
        <li>up to date firewall software</li>
        <li>up to date antispyware software</li>
        <li>pop up blocker on your browser</li>
        <li>install the latest Security patches or updates to you OS</li>
        <li>dont send personal or financial information in repsonse to any email</li>
    </ol>

   <h3>Brackets:</h3>

   <ol>
        <li>What is Brackets?<br/>A modern text editor that makes it easy to design in the browser </li>    
        <li>How much does it cost?<br/>$0 </li>
        <li>Describe several extentions you can download to enhance Brackets:<br/>various themes, search within project files, cloud snycing</li>
   </ol>

   <h3>Crypt Games:</h3>
    
   <ol>
        <li>Easy ciphers game: pig pen cipher- substitution cipher that switches characters for symbols</li>
        <li>Normal ciphers game: polybius square cipher- use the encrypted message like coordinates</li>
        <li>Hard ciphers game: vigenere cipher- use a letter of the key and encrypted message to find each letter of the decrypted message </li>
   </ol>
