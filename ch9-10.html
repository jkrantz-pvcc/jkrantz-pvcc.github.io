    <h2>Student: Joseph Krantz</h2>

    <h2>Chapter 9: Introduction to High Level Languages</h2>

    <h3>List four disadvantages of using assembly languages:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>the programmer must manually manage the movement of data items between and among memory locations and registers</li>
        <li>the programmer must take a microscopic view of a task, breaking it down into tiny subtask that direct what is going on in individual memory locations and registers</li>
        <li>assembly language program is machine specific</li>
        <li>statements are not natural-language-like</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>List four expectations progrmamer have for writing programs in a high-level language ("third generation" language):</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>programmers need not manage the details  of the movement of data items within memory or pay and attention to exactly where those items are stored</li>
        <li>programmers can take a macroscopic view of task, thinking at a higher level of problem solving, primitive operations used as building blocks in algorithm construction can be larger</li>
        <li>programs are portable rather than machine specific</li>
        <li>programming statements are closer to natural language and use standard mathematical notation</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Briefly describe or define:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>object code- machine language intructions</li>
        <li>source code- high-level language intructions</li>
        <li>procedural language- programming language in which programs consist of sequences of statements that manipulate data items</li>
        <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)- a collection of programs that support software development, such as debuggers, editors, toolkits, and libraries, that lets programmers perform several tasks within the shell of a single applicatio</li>
        <li>software development life cycle- the overall sequence of steps needed to complete a large-scale software project</li>
        <li>waterfall model of software development- traditional model of software development that follows a series of steps</li>
        <li>agile model of software development- software development that emphasizes a flexible and ready response to meet a shifting target</li>
    </ol>

   <h3>Describe each of these components of the software development life cycle:</h3>

   <ol>
        <li>feasibility study- evaluates a proposed project and compares the costs and benefits of various solutions</li>    
        <li>problem specification- developing a clear, concise, and unambiguous statement of the exact problem the software is to solve</li>
        <li>program design- plans the structure of the software to be written</li>
        <li>algorith selection- chosing or developing the algorithm for the various subtasks</li>
        <li>coding- translating the detailed designs into computer code</li>
        <li>debugging- locating and correcting program errors</li>
        <li>testing- making sure the program produces correct answers and on all data</li>
        <li>verification- prove that if the input data to a program satisfies certain conditions, then, after the program has been run on this data, the output data satisfies certain other conditions</li>
        <li>documentation- all of the written and online material that makes a program understandable</li>
        
   </ol>
