    <h1>Chapter 1: An Introduction to Computer Science</h1>

    <h2>Student: Joseph Krantz</h2>

    <h3>Three misconceptions about Computer Science:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Computer science is the study of computers</li>
        <li>Computer science is the study of how to write computer programs</li>
        <li>Computer science is the study of the uses and applications of computers and software</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Briefly define:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Computer Science- the study of algorithms, icluding their mathmatical properties, hardware and linguistic realizations, and their applications </li>
        <li>Algorithm- a collection of unambiguous and effectively computable operations that produces a result </li>
        <li>Sequential operation- a single well-defined task that when finished moves to the next operation</li>
        <li>Conditonal operation- a question and a follow up operation based on the answer</li>
        <li>Iterative operation- used to repeat opertaions</li>
        <li>Stored program computer- intructions are represented as binary string and stored in memory</li>
        <li>Programmer- a person who writes commands in a high-level language</li>
        <li>Intergrated circuit- silicon with transistors, resistors, and capacitors, that replace the need for discrete electornic compontents </li>        
    </ol>

    <h3>Briefly describe these computer generations</h3>

     <ol>
        <li>First generation computer- bulky, expensive, slow, and unreliable. vacuum tubes for processing and storage and were difficult to maintain and only used by trained personnel</li>
        <li>Second generation computer- reduced size and cost, increased reliability, vacuum tube replaced by transistors and memory on tiny magnetic cores</li>
        <li>Third generation computer- reduced to desk-sized, intergrated circuits with transistors, resistors, and capacitors. birth of the software industry</li>
        <li>Fourth generation computer- desktop-size, a complete computer system circuit board could fit in your hand, computer networks, computers in many more things</li>
        <li>Fifth generation computer- mini computers everywhere, larger storage, high-resolution grapchics, faster computing</li>     
                
    </ol>

    <h3>FORTRAN:</h3>

     <ol>
        <li>Formula Translation</li>
        <li>1954</li>
        <li>General purpose programming, mainly intended for mathematical computaitions</li>
        <li>Fortran is still used in scientific computing</li>
               
    </ol>

    <h3>COBOL:</h3>

     <ol>
        <li>Common Business Oriented Language</li>
        <li>1959</li>
        <li>Business programs</li>
        <li>Cobol is still used by banks</li>
               
    </ol>
