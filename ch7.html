    <h2>Student: Joseph Krantz</h2>

    <h3>Briefly describe or define</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>computer network- computers connected together for the purpose of sharing personal communications, hardware and software resources, and information</li>
        <li>analog device- the physical quantity used to represent information is continuous and can take on any value(switched dial-up telephone lines)</li>
        <li>digital device- transmits information as 0s and 1s(computers)</li>
        <li>modem- device that modulates or alters, a standard analog signal called a carrier so that it encodes binary information</li>
        <li>bandwith- rate at which information could be sent and received</li>
        <li>ethernet- most widely used broadband technology</li>
        <li>WLAN- a wireless network in which the user transmits from their computer to a local wireless base station that is < a few hundred feet away and is connected to a wired network</li>
        <li>IEEE 802.11 wireless network standard- another name for Wifi</li>
        <li>MAN- a network whose scope is larger that the few hundred feet of a LAN, typically a few blocks up to an entire city</li>
        <li>Internet of Things- everything has a digital device that can communicate </li>
        <li>LAN- network that connects hardware devices that are all in close proximity</li>
        <li>repeater- device that amplifes and forwards a signal</li>
        <li>bridge- has knowledge about the nodes located on each seperate network, examines every message to see if it should be forwarded from one network to another</li>
        <li>WAN- connects devices that are not in close proximity but rather are across town, the county, or the ocean</li>
        <li>packet and packet switching- information block with a fixed max size that is transmitted through the network as a single unit. used by WANs to deliver messages that "hop" from one node to another to make their way from source to destination</li>
        <li>ISP- business whose purpose is to provide access from a private network or from an individual's computer to the Internet</li>
        <li>firewall- software or hardware components that controls access from a network to a computer system</li>  
        <li>protocal- a mutually agreed upon set of rules, conventions, and agreements for the efficient and orderly exchange of information</li>
        <li>Cloud Computing- a computing system in which the user can be completely unaware of where data is stored and where services are being provided</li>
        <li>net neutrality- the concept that a public information network such as an ISP should treat all users, all platforms, and all content equally</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Briefly describe the five layers of TCP/IP:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>physical layer- governs the exchange of binary digits across a physical communication channel, such as fiber-optic cable, copper wire, or wireless radio channel</li>
        <li>data link layer- identifying the start and end of a message, determines whether a message did or didnt arrive correctly and if not getting a correct copy </li>
        <li>network layer- ensure that a message is delivered from the site where it was created to its ultimate destination</li>
        <li>transport layer- create a program to program delivery service, move messages from a specific program at the source to a specifi program at the destination</li>
        <li>application layer- the rules for implementing the end user services provied by a network</li>

    </ul>
        
       
    <h3>List and briefly describe at least 3 network services and benefits:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Interpersonal communications- email, forums, texting, chat rooms</li>
        <li>Resource sharing- file servers, groupware, data warehouses </li>
        <li>Electronic commerce- use of computers and networking to support the paperless exchange of goods, information, and services</li>

    </ol>

   <h3>IEEE:</h3>

   <ul>
        <li>What does the acronym, IEEE, stand for?<br/>Institute of Electircal and Electronics Engineers </li>    
        <li>What is the mission and vision of IEEE?<br/>IEEE is dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity </li>
        <li>What are the benefits of IEEE membership?<br/>access learning resources and career boosting opportunities for students and access into a global network of experts and stay at the forefront of technological advancement for professionals </li>
        <li>What are the requirements for IEEE student membership, and how much does undergraduate membership cost annually for students from the USA?<br/>carry at least 50 percent of a full time accademic program in an IEEE designated field, $32 annual dues </li>

   </ul>
