    <h2>Chapter 12: Models of Computation</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>What is the purpose of a model? <br/>to have a simple "idealized" computer</li>
        <li>List four phenomena of a model:
            <ul>
            <li>a. captures the important properties of the real thing</li>
            <li>b. probably differs in scale from the real thing</li>
            <li>c. omits some of the details of the real thing</li>
            <li>d. lacks the full functionality of the real thing</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>List four things a computing agent should be able to do:
           <ul>
            <li>a. accept input</li>
            <li>b. store information in memory and retrieve it from memory</li>
            <li>c. act in accordance with algorithm instructions</li>
            <li>d. produce output</li></ul> 
        </li>
        <li>List four characteristics of an algorithm:
            <ul>
            <li>a. a well-ordered collection</li>
            <li>b. consist of unambiguous and effectively computable operations</li>
            <li>c. halt in a finite amount of time</li>
            <li>d. produce a result</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>What is the "halting problem" with regards to an uncomputable problem? <br/>decide, given any collection of Turing machine instructions together with any initial tape contents, whether that Turing machine will ever halt if started on that tape</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Chapter 13: Simulation & Modeling</h2>

    <h3>Define these terms:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>scientic method- observing the behavior of a system and formulating a hypothesis that tries to understand and explain that behavior</li>
        <li>computational model- a model constructed using algorithmic procedures implemented as computer programs</li>
        <li>discrete event simulation- a computational modeling technique that simulates that behavior of a system only at discrete points in time</li>
        <li>List and describe seven reasons to construct a simulation model
            <ul>
            <li>existence- the system might not exist</li>
            <li>physical realization- the system is not constructed from entities that can be represented by physical objects</li>
            <li>safety- could be too dangerous to experiment on the actual system or a physical replica</li>
            <li>speed of construction- might take too much time to construct a physical model</li>
            <li>time scale- some physical systems change too slowly or too quickly</li>
            <li>ethical behavior- some physical models have serious moral and ethical consequences</li>
            <li>ease of modification- easier to test and change than a physical model </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Illustris: "The Mother of All Computations"</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>What is Illustris?<br/>a large cosmological simulation of galaxy formation</li>
        <li>What fields of science were involved in the Illustris computational model?<br/>hydrodynamics, astrolophysics</li>
        <li>What does Illustris simulate?<br/>galaxy formtations</li>
        <li>How long did the project take?<br/>19 million CPU hours</li>
        <li>How many years of gallactic evolution are simulated in Illustris?<br/>13.8 billion years</li>
        <li>Illustris was created using two supercomputers. What is a supercomputer?<br/> a powerfull computer that can perform complex calculations and process massive amounts of data at incredibly high speeds</li>
