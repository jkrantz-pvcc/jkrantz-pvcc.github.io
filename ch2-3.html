    <h2>Student: Joseph Krantz</h2>

    <h3>Chapter 2: Algorithms</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Natural language is not effective at describing algorithms because it lacks structure and can be interpretated in different ways.</li>
        <li>Problem 1: <ol>
            <li>grade1= x</li>
            <li>grade2= y</li>
            <li>grade3= z</li>
            <li>t= x+y+z</li>
            <li>finalgrade= t/3</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>Problem 2: <ol>
            <li>premil= x</li>
            <li>curmil= y</li>
            <li>gal= z</li>
            <li>miles= y-x</li>
            <li>mpg= miles/z</li>

        </ol></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chapter 2: Briefly define:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>natural language is the language we speak and write</li>
        <li>pseudocode is a notation to design and represent algorithms</li>
        <li>sequential operations execute code in a straight line top to bottom then stops</li>
        <li>input operations give the computing agent data from the outside world to be used</li>
        <li>output operations send results from the computing agent to the outside world </li>
        <li>conditional statements are the question asking operations of an algorithm(if/then/else)</li>
        <li>boolean condition are true/false yes/no</li>
        <li>algorithm discovery process is finding a correct and efficient algorithm to solve a problem</li>
    </ol>
       
<h3>Chapter 3:Briefly describe or define</h3>

     <ol>
        <li>algorithms should be correct so that they solve the right problem and solve the problem right </li>     
        <li>algorithms should be efficient so that it takes up less storage space and executes faster</li>
        <li>program maintence is the upkeep and modification of a program to correct errors or expand its functionality</li>
        <li>ease of understanding is important for maintence, often the person who is fixing the code did not write it </li>
        <li>algorithmic elegance is the simplicity of an algorithm that could lead to misunderstandings</li>
        <li>sequential search algorithms seatch for a target value in a random list by checking each list item in turn</li>
        <li>order of magnitude is the efficiency classification of an algorithm whose work vaires as a constant times the input size n</li>
        <li>selection sort algorithm keeps moving the larger items towards the back of the list</li>
        <li>flops are used to compare different makes of computers by giving the number of arithmetic operations</li>
        <li>teraflop- 16 trillion flops</li>
        <li>petaflop- 93 quadrillion flops</li>
        <li>parallet processor is two processors working on the same algorithm at the same time together</li>
        <li>data cleanup omits unwanted data</li>
        <li>binary search algorithm searches for a target value in a sorted list by checking at the midpoint and then repeatedly cutting the search section in half </li>
        <li>pattern matching algorithms move through text at each position to match the pattern character to the text</li>
